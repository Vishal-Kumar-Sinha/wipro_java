/*
Implement a class hierarchy for Vehicles with a base class Vehicle 
that contains a method startEngine(). Derive two classes: Car and 
Motorcycle, both overriding the startEngine() method to print different 
messages indicating how their engines are started. Create a method 
vehicleTestDrive(Vehicle vehicle) that accepts any object of type 
Vehicle and calls its startEngine() method. Demonstrate polymorphism 
by passing different vehicle objects to this method.
