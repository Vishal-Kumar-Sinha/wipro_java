/*
Create a class structure for a Shape Drawing Application. Start 
with an abstract class Shape with a method draw(). Derive two 
classes: Circle and Rectangle. Implement the draw() method in both 
derived classes to display specific messages such as “Drawing a 
Circle” and “Drawing a Rectangle”. In the main program, create an 
array of Shape objects (including both circles and rectangles) and 
call the draw() method on each. Demonstrate polymorphism through this 
array.
