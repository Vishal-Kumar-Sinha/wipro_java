/*
Create a class hierarchy for a Library System. Implement a base class Item with 
properties like title, author, and publicationYear. Derive two classes, Book and 
Magazine, from the Item class. Each derived class should have additional properties 
such as genre for books and issueNumber for magazines. Write methods in each class 
to display their details. Demonstrate the use of inheritance by creating objects of 
both classes and calling their respective methods.
